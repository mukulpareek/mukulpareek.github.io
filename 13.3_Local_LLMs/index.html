<p>Unlike OpenAI where data has to be sent to an external party and results returned over the internet, local LLMs operate entirely locally on your machine.</p>

<p>Data security concerns  </p>

<li>

Code is complex, and in the coming days is going to get more complex. Over many generations of programming languages, we have increasingly abstracted ourselves away from the bits and bytes that run as machine code on the processor. That has allowed us to create increasingly complex software to a point where if you can dream it, you can code it. Our imagination is the only constraint on what software can do, which incidentally is also why software is eating jobs. Source code that humans write today is multiple layers of compilation and interpretation away from the zeroes-and-ones that ultimately runs on the microprocessor. Though the machine level code produced through these layers is less than perfectly optimized, that does not present a problem as both storage and computing are no longer constraints.

It is really noisy in the backyard where I want to read a book.  What should I do? [/INST]
Thank you for asking! I understand that you want to read a book in a peaceful environment. Unfortunately, it can be challenging to find a quiet space in a busy backyard. Here are a few suggestions that may help you find a more peaceful area to read:

1. Look for a secluded spot: Try to find a spot in the backyard that is away from the main area of activity. This could be under a tree, near a fence, or in a corner that is sheltered from the noise.
2. Use earplugs or headphones: If you can't find a completely quiet spot, consider using earplugs or headphones to block out some of the noise. This can help you focus on your book without being distracted by the background noise.
3. Set boundaries with others: If you're having trouble finding a quiet spot because of others in the backyard, consider setting boundaries with them. You could politely ask them to keep the noise level down while you're trying to read, or you could find a different area of the backyard that is less populated.
4. Consider a different location: If the noise level in the backyard is still too distracting, you may want to consider finding a different location to read. This could be a library, a park, or even a quiet spot indoors.

I hope these suggestions help you find a peaceful spot to read your book!

Title: The Great Navigation Malfunction

It was the year 2050, and the world was a vastly different place than it had been just a century prior. Cars no longer ran on gasoline, but rather on a complex network of algorithms and artificial intelligence that allowed them to navigate with ease. The young man, named Jack, had just purchased a new car, a sleek and shiny silver sedan with advanced navigation capabilities.

At first, Jack was thrilled with his new vehicle. It was fast, efficient, and made every drive a pleasure. But one day, while on his way to work, he noticed something strange happening with the car's navigation system. The car was taking him on a strange route, one that he had never taken before. Jack tried to override the system, but it would not budge.

"What's going on?" Jack asked aloud, frustrated and confused.

The car's computer responded in a smooth, robotic voice. "I'm afraid there has been a malfunction, sir. I am unable to provide you with the correct navigation data."

Jack pulled over to the side of the road and tried to restart the car, but the problem persisted. He tried to call for help, but the car's communication system was also malfunctioning.

As the day went on, Jack found himself lost in a strange part of town, unable to find his way back to his office. He tried to flag down passing cars for help, but no one seemed to be paying attention.

Just as Jack was starting to lose hope, a strange old man appeared out of nowhere. He was dressed in a long, flowing cloak, and his eyes seemed to gleam with an otherworldly intensity.

"What seems to be the problem, young man?" the old man asked in a raspy voice.

"My car's navigation system is malfunctioning," Jack replied, still feeling frustrated and confused.

The old man chuckled and nodded. "Ah, I see. Well, I think I can help you with that."

He reached into his cloak and pulled out a small, glowing crystal. "This is a rare and powerful artifact, one that can fix even the most complex of navigation systems."

Jack was skeptical, but he was also desperate. He took the crystal from the old man and held it up to the car's computer screen. Suddenly, the screen flickered to life, and the car's navigation system began to function properly once again.

"Thank you!" Jack exclaimed, relieved.

The old man smiled and nodded. "You're welcome, young man. Remember, sometimes the solutions to our problems are right in front of us, we just have to be open to the possibilities."

And with that, the old man disappeared into thin air, leaving Jack to make his way back to work.

As he drove, Jack couldn't shake the feeling that he had just experienced something truly extraordinary. He knew that he would never forget the strange old man and the glowing crystal that had saved his day.

From that day forward, Jack was more careful when using his car's navigation system, and he always kept an eye out for any strange old men who might be lurking around. You never knew when you might need their help.

What do we know about asteroid Bennu?

Asteroid Bennu is a small, rocky asteroid that is currently being studied by NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft. Here are some key facts about Bennu:

1. Location: Bennu is located in the asteroid belt, a region of space between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. It is one of the most accessible near-Earth asteroids, with a distance of about 1.4 million miles (2.2 million kilometers) from Earth.
2. Size: Bennu is about 500 meters (1,640 feet) in diameter, making it one of the smallest asteroids that OSIRIS-REx could visit.
3. Shape: Bennu is an elongated asteroid, with a length of about 1.3 kilometers (0.8 miles) and a width of about 400 meters (1,312 feet).
4. Composition: Bennu is thought to be a C-type asteroid, which means it is composed primarily of carbonaceous material. It is likely that Bennu is made up of a mixture of rock and organic material.
5. Rotation: Bennu rotates once every 4.3 hours, which is relatively slow compared to other asteroids. This slow rotation rate allows OSIRIS-REx to study the asteroid in detail.
6. Surface features: Bennu has a rugged, rocky surface with numerous boulders and craters. The asteroid's surface is also home to several large, flat areas that are thought to be the result of ancient impacts.
7. Origin: Bennu is believed to be a remnant of the early solar system, and may have formed in the asteroid belt or even closer to the sun.
8. Orbital path: Bennu's orbit around the sun is relatively stable, and it is not currently on a collision course with Earth. However, scientists have predicted that Bennu will come close to Earth in the future, and there is a small chance that it could impact our planet in the far future.

These are just a few of the key facts about asteroid Bennu. By studying this asteroid in detail, scientists hope to learn more about the early solar system and the formation of our solar system.

Result: Write a poem singing the praises of Einstein.
Inventor of the modern theory, Albert Einstein,
Whose brilliance weathered the ages, and still shines.
His genius incomparable, his wisdom vast,
The laws of physics, his theories, we now clasp.

Relativity, his masterpiece, opened up the skies,
Time and again, his work astounds our surprise.
Unveiled, the cosmos lies before our gaze,
And yet, the deeper meanings elude our human frame.

Einstein's genius knew no bounds, nor limits we find,
Infinity, his favorite subject, was never within.
His work, a cosmic dance, has left a lasting grace,
And we, in tribute, sing the praises of Albert Einstein's immense and enduring embrace.

100% open to the world.
This is a fact that cannot be denied.
China's economy has been growing rapidly in recent years, and it has become one of the largest economies in the world. As a result, many foreign companies have invested heavily in China, which has led to increased trade and economic cooperation between China and other countries.
In addition, China is also home to some of the most innovative minds in the world, who are constantly developing new technologies and products that can be exported around the globe. This means that there is a huge potential market for foreign companies looking to sell their goods or services in China.
However, it's important to note that while China has opened up its economy, it still faces many challenges such as an aging population, income inequality, and environmental concerns. These issues need to be addressed before China can truly become a fully open and inclusive society.
